TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
this week i studyed how to read code and read code skills and i know what is valid variable names and what is Invalid variable names.If you want writs a order  you must write spacebar behind word or symbol such us spam = 20 and i know str() inside the bracket must is a number or word. .upper() is mean uppercase.I know some symbols mean for example == mean equal to or != is mean not equal to 
and i know  if i use a matrix for example spam =['cat','bat','rat','elephant'] if i input spam[0] then will appear 'cat'.Have one thing is really important is if we write write a code we must use '' this sympol and if you want calculate a number you just write for example spam =24, egg =24 and then spam + egg then ehn can calculate the number and i understand some types for write code for explme
if you want appear ['*','*','*','*','*'] 
my_list1 = []
for fz in  range (5)
  my_list1.append('*')
  print(my_list1)
  or you want to appear [['*','*','*']，['*','*','*']['*','*','*']]
  my_list1 = []
  for count in range (3)
      my-list2 = []
      for count2 in range (3)
          my_list2.append("*")

          my_list1.append(my_list2)
          print(my_list1)
and i know some functions.if you want to get a odd number you need to use return a_number % 2 == 1.True and True is flase.  True and flase is flase.flase and true is flase.flase and flase is flase and we must remember sometimes behind () we must plus:，when you make a like counte don't use number.
