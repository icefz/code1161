TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
this week i studyed how to read code and read code skills and i know what is valid variable names and what is Invalid variable names.If you want writs a order  you must write spacebar behind word or symbol such us spam = 20 and i know str() inside the bracket must is a number or word. .upper() is mean uppercase.I know some symbols mean for example == mean equal to or != is mean not equal to 
and i know  if i use a matrix for example spam =['cat','bat','rat','elephant'] if i input spam[0] then will appear 'cat'.Have one thing is really important is if we write write a code we must use '' this sympol and if you want calculate a number you just write for example spam =24, egg =24 and then spam + egg then ehn can calculate the number
