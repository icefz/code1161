TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I think week 3 homework is really difficult ,i have some question don't understand like exercise1 second question and sixth question and i have a wrong code in the exercise3 i don't know how to fix it,through i have some questions don;t know,some questions i can understand like  x = start
    list1 = []
    while x < stop:
      list1.append(x)
      x = x + step
    return list1
is mean x is start and x must less than stop and step is 1 and then start add 1 until less than stop is like start is 10 and step is 1 stop is 15 start add 1 until 14 and then will stop in the 14. 
x = start
    list3 = []
    while x < stop:
        if x == 0:
            list3.append(x)
            x = x + odd_step
            x = 1
        else:
            list3.append(x)
            x = x + even_step
            x = 0

    return(list3)   and this question is maen we must add step is even_number or odd_number and also start number must less than stop number and .append mean make this number put in the list.
    And i want next week ask teacher about some difficuly question.
